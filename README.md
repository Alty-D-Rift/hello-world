# hello-world


Beginner Programmer Alty here. Began my career as a ballet dancer, now trying something different. Love videogames, fantasy, scifi, stories, dancing, singing, photography, and anything that includes those things. Have been told I'm a unicorn which means I'm either rare or I don't exist. You decide

Also, anyone who gets the reference in my user name and is a fellow fan, I will be glad to geek out with you (for those with dirty humour-I know. But it's not that kind reference)
